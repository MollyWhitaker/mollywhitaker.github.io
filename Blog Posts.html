            <h3> A closer look at the reasons why climate change has become such a divisive and contentious topic </h3>
            <p>
                Wednesday January 27th, 2021

              Before analyzing different climate controversies and the policies which Biden will face as the 46th president of the United States, it is crucial to understand how and when United States climate policy was born, as it was not always such a selling point in a presidential election. President Richard Nixon was arguably the first president to take seriously and act upon information he received from scientists and lead experts about climate change. This could have been because ignoring climate change at this point in time was unwise and simply not an option. President George H. W. Bush, however, has been named “the environmental president”, as he was arguably the most conscious of and deliberate with climate change policy. For the purpose of this blog, however, I will focus on climate policy evolution starting with the Obama era. </p>
            </p>
              <p>
                Climate policy is difficult and has become quite controversial, as it has the potential to threaten established industries such as oil drilling, coal mining, transportation, and development. All of these industries have provided the United States with economic success for so many years, which is might explain a president’s hesitancy to impose strict climate policy as part of their campaign strategies. Climate change wasn’t always the partisan issue it has become today, however. Scientists have been gathering information pertaining to evidence of climate change as far back as the 19th century and have unanimously decided that climate change is real and is based on real scientific evidence. But climate scientists struggle to prove this fact to the general public, due to economic stakeholders and other important leaders in this country.

                In 1957, Humble Oil (now called ExxonMobil) published a paper explaining that CO2 affects the atmosphere and our oceans and that the largest contributor to this phenomenon is the combustion of fossil fuels (Greenpeace n.d.). A strange, rather self-sabotaging move from an industry that relies on fossil fuels, but this actually happened. It wasn’t until the 1970’s that ExxonMobil and other big oil companies realized their mistake and began to withhold climate change information and distribute it in a way that denies the existence of climate change while simultaneously removing the blame and attention on these companies (Greenpeace, n.d.). <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/exxon-and-the-oil-industry-knew-about-climate-change/exxons-climate-denial-history-a-timeline/" target="_blank" > Read more on the GreenPeace website. </a> These companies then banded together to work on a “Global Climate Science Communications Plan”, a multi-million-dollar plan that consisted of convincing target audiences such as the media, teachers, and policy makers that climate change was a hoax. By instilling doubt in these important audiences, oil companies have been able to maintain a business-as-usual model, continuing to maintain authority over the American people.

                Republicans support economic success through free markets and individual achievements and Democrats support equal access and the investment of the government in the well-being of their people (Wikipedia 2021). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)#Political_positions" target="_blank" > Read more about the Democratic Party. </a> &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" target="_blank" > Read more about the Republican Party. </a> &nbsp; Until science, specifically climate science, became more a part of the Democrat identity these beliefs were respected and did not evoke such controversy as they do today. According to a study performed by the Pew Research Center, over the past four years there has been a significant increase of Americans who identify as Democrats or Democrat-leaning independents who believe climate change should be a top priority. But Republicans have shown no statistically significant increase (Pew Research Center 2020). &nbsp; <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/28/more-americans-see-climate-change-as-a-priority-but-democrats-are-much-more-concerned-than-republicans/" target="_blank" > Read more about the Pew Research Center's study. </a> &nbsp; This could be because Republicans want companies like ExxonMobil to be successful, and so they tend to believe the information these companies are distributing. Democrats, however, tend to view climate change as a threat to their desire for equal access and can see right through the dissemination of incorrect and altered information by these oil companies. This means that presidents who run as Republicans have a tendency to deny or ignore climate change in order to garner support from your typical Republican and therefore do not prioritize climate policy as much as a Democratic candidate might. Obama, being a democratic president, enacted a breadth of climate policy within his two terms which was then reversed by the Trump administration and will likely be reversed again by the Biden administration. The following blog posts will cover specific executive orders regarding climate policy that Biden has mentioned in his first month as president, as well as some of my opinions regarding whether this policy makes sense to focus on in his short time as president and whether certain policies are more of a band-aid solution.

                <h3> The evolution of the regulation of emissions from Obama to Biden </h3>
                <p>
                    Wednesday February 3rd, 2021
                </p>
                <p>
                The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963, was the first EPA ruling to acknowledge that air pollution is a determinant of public health. This was a revolutionary move on the part of the EPA, as this was a time of heavy industrialization with no regulations, which allowed for a compromised environment. This act has since been amended in both 1977 and 1990, with both amendments providing better goals for NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) for certain states who were previously failing to reach their goals (EPA 2021). <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act" target="_blank" > Read more about the Clean Air Act on the EPA website. </a>
              </p>
                <p>
                  The 1990 Clean Air Act mainly strived to develop technology-based standards for “major sources” and “certain area sources”. Major sources are “a stationary source or group of stationary sources that emit or have the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of a hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of a combination of hazardous air pollutants” (EPA 2021).  An area source is “any stationary source that is not a major source” (EPA 2021). Major sources of air pollution require the maximum degree of reduction, which are referred to as maximum achievable control technology, or MACT. After eight years of establishing MACT in a certain source area, the EPA is required to evaluate their standards and determine if there is residual risk in that source category and revise these standards to address said risk, if a risk is determined. This was only the beginning of the recognition that greenhouse gases and other air pollutants have the potential to harm human health and therefore should be regulated in some capacity.
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                    Since the establishment of the Clean Air Act, many administrations have had to adapt to new information surrounding climate change and create rulings through the EPA that “piggy-back” the concept of air pollution as both a health hazard as well as a threat to climate change. The Obama administration passed the Clean Power Plan, which set the first ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants, setting a precedent that it was no longer acceptable to emit unregulated amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere (Environmental Defense Fund 2021)<a href="https://www.edf.org/clean-power-plan-resources" target="_blank" > Read more about the Clean Power Plan on the EDF website. </a> &nbsp; This ruling worked to reduce carbon emissions while allowing for forms of clean energy to enter the economy. Not only did the Clean Power Plan work to reduce carbon emissions and implement new forms of energy, but it also provided an incentive to the first states who got behind this ruling, providing them with more investment opportunities in clean energy. Unfortunately, this rule only lasted from 2015 until June 19, 2019, when Trump decided to rid of the ruling and establish the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE). 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Affordable Energy Rule claims to provide more realistic goals for coal fired EGU’s, or electricity generating units (EPA 2021) <a href="https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/affordable-clean-energy-rule" target="_blank" > Read more about the ACE Rule on the EPA's website. </a> &nbsp; This ruling provides states with revised goals that will “inform the state’s development of standards of performance to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired EGU’s – consistent with the EPA’s role as defined in the CAA” (EPA 2021). The EPA under the Obama administration was shocked when the Supreme Court replaced the CPP rule with the ACE rule and believed that “the Clean Power Plan will be upheld when the merits are considered because the rule rests on strong scientific and legal foundations” (EPA 2021). They also stated that “the Court’s decision was not on the merits of the rule”, meaning that the Clean Power Rule was clearly a frontrunner when compared to the Affordable Clean Energy Rule. The EPA also mentions that “for states that choose to continue to work to cut carbon pollution from power plants and seek the agency’s guidance and assistance, EPA will continue to provide support” (EPA 2021). In mentioning that they will help regardless of the fate of the CPP rule, the EPA has shown solidarity with the Obama administration, believing that it was truly the best way to approach carbon pollution. But, when Trump tried to justify this ruling (among many other controversial climate change rulings), he began to break the relationship between science and politics, creating the political climate change divide we observe today. Lawsuits are still going to this day about getting rid of the Clean Power Rule and replacing it with something as unlawful and harmful as the Affordable Clean Energy Rule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With that in mind, Biden has his work cut out for him. While it is still unclear what Biden will do in respects to creating a new rule or adapting a version of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, he has been given the green light by the U.S. Court of Appeals for District of Columbia circuit to “craft a new rule to control greenhouse gas emissions from power plants” (Farah from E&E News 2021). The court determined that Trump’s ACE rule “too narrowly interpreted its authority to regulate emissions” (Farah from E&E News 2021). <a href="https://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1063722969/search?keyword=farah" target="_blank" > Read more in this EENews article. </a> &nbsp; Many experts are astonished that a new rule under Biden’s administration did not have the same fate as the Clean Power Rule, signifying the responsibility of the EPA to reduce emissions and help to slow climate change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it has not been clear what Biden’s next move will be in terms of an emissions rule with the EPA, rumors about a potential carbon tax have arisen. This would effectively reward those who do not emit tons of carbon and “punish” those who do, which means large emitters such as power plants would have to make the choice of whether to operate under a business-as-usual model or save money by finding new ways to operate. The Chamber of Commerce is hoping for a market-based approach to carbon emissions, placing a tax on carbon as well as emissions caps (Dlouhy from Bloomberg News 2021). <a href="https://www.thedailyworld.com/business/in-switch-chamber-of-commerce-endorses-climate-action-possible-carbon-tax/" target="_blank" > Read more about the potential carbon tax here. </a> &nbsp; Marty Durbin, president of the chamber’s Global Energy Institute, believes that since Congress is so evenly divided and Biden is extremely progressive in his approach to climate change, that Congress should lead with policies that have bipartisan agreement and drive them forward. Durbin also mentions that market-based solutions to climate change have previously been passed by lawmakers consisting of taxes on carbon dioxide and cap-and-trade (which requires companies to buy “credits” in order to lawfully emit greenhouse gases), which points in the direction of a potential carbon tax in the near future and a new rule that reflects the work done by the Clean Power Plan rather than the disappointing Affordable Clean Energy Rule (Dlouhy from Bloomberg News 2021). 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the first section of his Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis, Biden makes many broad statements, saying he will “hold polluters accountable, including those who disproportionally harm communities of color and low-income communities; reduce greenhouse gas emissions…” (Biden 2021). <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/" target="_blank" > Read more about this executive order here. </a> &nbsp; These statements, as I mentioned above, are extremely broad and are almost expected from a president now-a-days, especially one who preaches about all of the things he wants to do to slow climate change. But he does mention wanting to either suspend, revise or rescind existing policies, such as Reducing Methane Emissions in the Oil and Gas Sector, Protecting our Air From Harmful Pollution (which reflects the Clean Air Act), “Increasing Consistency and Transparency in Considering Costs and Benefits in the Clean Air Act Rulemaking Process”, and “Strengthening Transparency in Pivotal Science Underlying Significant Regulatory Actions and Influential Scientific Information” (Biden 2021). These policy changes seem promising, but I am definitely curious to see how much of his talk on carbon taxing or cap-and-trade is actually in the works/might happen and how much of it is a driven by political pressures.

                <h3> Keystone XL and Biden’s plans for drilling/oil and gas industries </h3>
                <p>
                    Wednesday February 10th, 2021
                </p>
                <p>
                  Biden’s first two weeks have been quite eventful, what with the many executive orders he has signed and unique situations he has had to deal with. As I mentioned in the last blog post, Biden’s plans for his version of the ACE/CPP seem to be pretty up in the air still (more aligned with Obama’s CPP approach), but his plans for oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline seem to be pretty clear for now. At the end of January, Biden placed a 60-day ban on new loans for oil drilling on federal lands. This ban will not allow any further drilling to be done, but still allows existing drilling to occur, especially those on private lands. Biden also cancelled all operations for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which spans from Alberta, Canada to the Gulf Coast in Texas (Denchak from NRDC 2021). <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/what-keystone-pipeline#controversy" target="_blank" > Read more about the Keystone XL Pipeline and its history here. </a> &nbsp; Both the ban on further drilling on federal lands and the halting of construction on the Keystone XL pipeline have left oil stakeholders rather dissatisfied, questioning the reasoning and drive behind these orders. Even though this ban on drilling is said to be temporary, it does expose Biden’s trajectory for the fossil fuel industry, and those company owners/employees are not happy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Keystone XL pipeline has been one of the most significant environmental debates in the last decade. There is much controversy surrounding the implications of this pipeline, as it passes through many indigenous lands as well as other unoccupied but precious United States land. However, building this pipeline would mean that the lush forests of Alberta could transport its valuable crude oil all the way to the Gulf Coast in Texas, increasing oil supply by 830,000 barrels a day (Denchak from NDRC 2021). This would increase oil supply and likely boost United States economy significantly, allowing the United States to source and distribute oil “locally”, rather than relying on international supplies. This is the main reason why those who favor the economy are so dissatisfied by this pipeline. It depends on who you ask, really. Those with a greater emphasis on the environment and those who live on indigenous lands which have been disrupted by its construction argue that this pipeline should not exist and agree with Biden’s cancellation plans. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    President Obama appealed to the environmentalists and indigenous people of the United States by vetoing its construction in 2015, considering the many environmental implications involved, acting on his desire for America to move towards clean energy (Denchak from NDRC 2021). Then, President Trump signed an executive order that advanced the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, reversing the actions of Obama’s administration. This was not a surprising move, considering Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy rule, which consisted of unambitious standards for emissions and therefore allowed industries like the oil industry to continue business-as-usual. President Biden, however, has again cancelled the pipeline’s construction, mimicking the views of Obama’s administration and placing more importance on shifting to clean energy and doing away with harmful oil pipelines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Biden’s 60-day ban on drilling has evoked a rather controversial response. Environmentalists are satisfied by the statement this temporary ban makes, allowing them to believe that Biden really is working to dismantle the oil industry in order to push for more clean energy. By placing a temporary ban on drilling, Biden has the opportunity to solidify a more permanent solution to the issues surrounding leasing for drilling, an issue which has not been acknowledged by a president in nearly four decades. He will also allow for the incorporation of more “ambitious conservation, taxpayer fairness, and climate goals” says Jenny Rowland-Shea, a senior policy analyst for public land at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank (Eilperin and Grandoni from Washington Post 2021). <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/25/biden-drilling-moratorium/" target="_blank" > Read more about the ban here </a> &nbsp; But dismantling this industry has heavy economic ties which will be hard to completely sever within four short years. Federal land drilling generated “nearly $8.1 billion in tax revenue for federal, state, local and tribal governments last year”, according to the Interior Department Office of Natural Resources Revenue (Eilperin and Grandoni from Washington Post 2021). At the same time, however, fossil fuel leasing accounts for a quarter of the United States’ annual carbon output (Eilperin and Grandoni from Washington Post 2021). This is why this industry is so difficult to do away with in such a short span of time as president and why some believe that Biden is overpromising and will end up underdelivering. Even though we are aware of the impact fossil fuels have on the state of our environment, we are almost irreversibly connected to this industry due to the fact that it provides for a significant chunk of our economic well-being. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At first, a ban on federal land drilling might have appeared, in the eyes of environmentalists, to be a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, this temporary ban completely misses the mark in regards to an attempt to dismantle the oil industry and ignores the presence of existing drilling, especially on private lands. Groups such as the American Petroleum Institute are worried that this ban will “deprive state and local governments, as well as the U.S. Treasury, of needed revenue” (Eilperin and Grandoni from Washington Post 2021). Other oil actors have mentioned that banning future drilling in a more permanent sense could push the United States to import more oil to satisfy the unchanging demand. Some oil company employees are not as concerned with the drilling ban, noting that millions of acres of public and private land in the West and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, where much of the existing drilling is concentrated, will not be affected by the ban. In places such as Texas and New Mexico where this is an abundance of oil drilling, only 2% of Texas’ land and about one-third of New Mexico’s land is federally controlled, which will only push these states to transfer drilling from federal to private lands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This ban, in my opinion, appears to be more of a band-aid solution rather than something that could become permanent, since it does not interfere with current leases on federal land and does not even touch private land. Oil drilling on federal and public land only accounts for a small fraction of current oil drilling and will make a light dent if any on the current state of oil drilling. According to the American Petroleum Institute, 22% of US oil production and 12% of natural gas production occur on federal land and water, which is a small fraction of the whole industry. I also find it interesting that Biden’s administration will not ban fracking. This seems to me like they are aware that if they are banning something to do with oil production, they can only choose one and they have chosen to tackle drilling. Though starting with a ban on drilling on federal land might appear to be a step towards eventually banning the entire industry, I feel that it is an ineffective solution to solving an extremely complex and multi-faceted dilemma. Many industry operators hold undeveloped leases, which are unaffected by this ban and have the ability to maintain the influence of oil drilling, should this ban be upheld. It is also notable that cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline will also negatively influence oil supply and will not affect the current statues of supply and demand for oil, making heating bills and other costs for consumers more expensive, which may decrease public support from both Democrats and Republicans (Daley from AP 2021). <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-climate-climate-change-environment-energy-and-the-environment-71001caf45220548deb26343d3889816" target="_blank" > Read more about the implications of cancelling this pipeline here. </a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This temporary ban is neither effective in dismantling the oil industry nor is it effective in decreasing the demand for oil. Before implementing a ban on drilling, Biden must consider demand of the American people for the most accessible form of energy (oil) and first work towards making other cleaner forms more accessible, affordable and overall appealing. Biden has mentioned plans for transitioning to clean energy in the United States and how it has the ability to provide an equivalent number of jobs to those currently represented in the fossil fuel industry, which I hope is true if clean energy successfully replaces the fossil fuel industry. Trump also approved thousands of drilling permits before the end of his presidency, which again, are unaffected by this ban and will continue to thrive for years to come without further action, undercutting the premise of Biden’s campaign. Though this ban has been acknowledged as a temporary solution, Biden must do more than ban future drilling. He must work tirelessly to make accessible these new forms of energy before dismantling an industry Americans rely upon and have relied upon for years, especially in the economically strained America we live in today.

                <h3> Electric vehicles, fuel economy standards and the production of clean energy </h3>
                <p>
                    Wednesday February 17th, 2021
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Electric vehicles have become are of the main topics when it comes to the Biden administration and their motifs surrounding climate change mitigation. Transportation accounts for a significant portion of our annual carbon emission totals, and if the United States wishes to proceed under the Paris Climate Agreement and minimize their emissions, targeting the transportation sector and improving clean energy sources are guaranteed to make a significant dent. While Biden’s plans for clean energy still remain elusive, his plans for the transportation sector are quite clear. In a segment called The Daily, Washington Post correspondent Coral Davenport reports on Biden’s plans to tackle the “big three” which she labels as pollution from cars, pollution from power plants, and leaking methane emissions from oil and gas wells (Davenport in an interview with Barbaro from the Daily 2021). <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/podcasts/the-daily/biden-climate-agenda.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank" > Read more of this interview here. </a> &nbsp; I talked about oil and gas drilling in last week’s blog post, noting that Biden’s temporary ban will do little if any to eliminate the damages of drilling as well as the threat for leaking methane emissions. This week, I plan to tackle the first two issues acknowledged by Davenport, which is pollution from cars and power plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During his presidency, Obama was recognized for his attempts to work towards eliminating power plant emissions and improving fuel economy standards. Biden is aligned closest to Obama in terms of these policies but reverting back to these exact rules is not sufficient given the increasing severity of climate change impacts today. It also doesn’t help that many of the Obama-era rules and policies in question were rolled back by Trump, eliminating any progress they could have had towards their goals. Biden will now have to change these rules simply because he must change the time frame in which they are to be enacted. Many Obama policies referenced the year 2026, including the Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule. This rule attempted to “tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions for passenger cars and light trucks and establish new standards” (EPA 2018). <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/safer-affordable-fuel-efficient-safe-vehicles-proposed" target="_blank" > Read more about this rule here. </a> &nbsp; By increasing standards for the years 2021-2026, this rule intended to save more than 500 billion dollars in societal costs as well as significantly reduce highway fatalities. More generally, this rule worked to improve carbon dioxide emissions through changes in transportation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  While it is still unclear what Biden will do with respects to a new rule or standard like the SAFE Vehicle Rule, he has mentioned his desire for a federal fleet of electric vehicles. The president’s fleet consists of 645,047 motor vehicles, so this would be a huge step in the right direction in terms of emphasizing production of electric vehicles (Meyer from the Atlantic 2021). <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/01/weekly-planet-why-biden-is-buying-645000-new-cars/617828/" target="_blank" > Read more about how important the timing of this rule is here. </a> &nbsp; The main reason many Americans and America’s leaders have not prioritized the production/purchase of electric vehicles is their cost/efficiency as well as a phenomenon called “range anxiety”. Many consumers feel that the lack of charging stations and their limited range makes combustion engine vehicles more convenient and reliable, especially for longer commutes. Since many car manufacturers continue to produce combustion engine vehicles, consumers have the ability and are more likely to choose them over electric vehicles, especially since electric vehicle infrastructure such as an abundance of charging stations is not as established. The government’s purchase of an all-electric vehicle fleet will drive down the price of electric vehicles for all consumers while simultaneously inspiring consumers to follow their lead. Though this may be a move in the right direction, it needs to be accomplished in a short time frame in order to make a significant impact on U.S. production of electric vehicles. For example, if Biden were to replace his federal fleet over the course of 5 years, that would mean purchasing 129,000 cars per year. For reference, that is a quarter of the number of electric vehicles produced by Tesla last year (Meyer from the Atlantic 2021). By placing a narrow time frame on the production of this all-electric fleet, the Biden administration would not only inspire Americans to purchase electric vehicles, but he would drive down consumer costs and increase the need for production of electric vehicles across all American manufacturers.

                  Many vehicle manufacturing companies like Ford and G.M. are moving in the direction of production of solely electric vehicles. G.M. has pledged to stop producing gasoline and diesel light-cars and SUVs by 2035, and it is assumed that other companies will follow their lead (Mufson from the Washington Post 2021). <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/28/general-motors-electric/" target="_blank" > Read more about GM's decision to go electric by 2035 here. </a> &nbsp; Though Tesla and Prius have produced electric and hybrid vehicles, infrastructure such as charging stations and their price drive consumers away from purchasing them, as they were perceived as expensive and unrealistic. Now that Biden has recognized the benefits of electric vehicles and has even announced that he wishes to make the federal fleet 100% electric, many manufacturers and consumers have higher faith in this market and have begun to acknowledge the benefit and necessity for electric vehicles. This acknowledgement will increase demand, which will have to increase supply, therefore creating a better market for electric vehicles in the United States. This is a major move in the right direction in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, since transportation is one of the major emitters of these dangerous gases.  However, if the Biden administration decides to invest in electric vehicle manufacturing, there is a need for more charging infrastructure as well as technology that works to improve charge time and potentially provide vehicles with a higher range for each charge to eliminate range anxiety.

                  Another major rule during the Obama-era was an EPA rule that regulated oil and gas emissions of methane and carbon dioxide by targeting new or modified oil and gas wells that would, “prevent 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by the year 2025” (EPA from Washington Post 2016). <a href= "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/05/12/obama-administration-announces-historic-new-regulations-for-methane-emissions-from-oil-and-gas/" target="_blank" > Read more about Obama's strict regulations on methane here. </a> &nbsp; This was a revolutionary move, since carbon dioxide had only ever been mentioned, despite methane being a close second to carbon dioxide in terms of its role in climate change. Like Biden’s temporary ban on future oil drilling on federal land, this ruling did not impact existing rigs, but the difference between Biden’s ban and this ruling is that the EPA had plans to regulate existing rigs, whereas these plans are still in the air for Biden’s drilling ban. Obama’s ruling also intended to fix leaks to not only curb the effects of methane emissions, but to improve the availability of gas for consumption and distribution. Though Biden tends to “cut and paste” Obama’s rulings when considering the direction of his own policies, copying this ruling will not be enough in terms of the current threat of methane and carbon dioxide emissions. Instead of attempting to fix these leaks for the purposes of more efficient gas production, the intention behind fixing these leaks under the Biden administration should be to eventually eliminate this infrastructure and implement clean energy mechanisms.

                  Electric vehicle production and the desire to move away from combustion engines is driven by greenhouse gas emissions and the Clean Air Act. All states must follow the mandates involved in the Clean Air Act, but in the past, there have been waivers that preempt certain states from following all of its components. California decided in 2013 that it would require stricter standards based on a compelling need, which led to the California Waiver. This waiver has the potential to be implemented in other states if California is successful in sticking to their stricter standards. The federal government, however, had recently revoked this waiver, taking with it the potential for more strict regulations and standards in other states. The claims involved in this revocation are “bogus” for many reasons, including the fact that it has been determined that California’s program is in fact needed as well as the fact that the Clean Air Act does not allow these waivers to be revoked (California Air Resources Board 2019). <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/california-waiver-facts" target="_blank" > Read more about the California Waiver here. </a> &nbsp; Under Biden, there is hope that this waiver will be reinstated and the potential for revoking future waivers will be stripped away. Since Biden has preached about his administration sticking to the facts and believing in science, I think this waiver revocation will soon be reversed to ensure that his administration is doing all they can in terms of the factual and scientific information available to them.

                  A major critique of the Obama-era was the “unrealistic” fuel economy standards. In 2012, the Obama administration finalized standards that will increase fuel economy to 54.5 MPG by 2025 in order to curb emissions (The White House 2012). <a href= "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/08/28/obama-administration-finalizes-historic-545-mpg-fuel-efficiency-standard" target="_blank" > Read more about Obama's fuel economy standards here. </a> &nbsp; A more fuel-efficient vehicle means less consumption of fuel and therefore lower oil prices and a decreased dependence on foreign oil. Many manufacturers were initially frustrated by this historic standard, as it proved to be a difficult goal to achieve. But once Trump rolled back these standards to only 40 MPG, many industries realized that this 40 MPG was being achieved/would be achieved without his new ruling. Obama also performed a midterm assessment of whether these standards were achievable and appropriate given the circumstances. When his administration determined that the 54.5 MPG by 2025 ruling was in fact achievable and appropriate, it was unfortunately rolled back by Trump to 40 MPG, angering those who supported Obama’s ruling (Roberts from Vox 2020). <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/4/2/21202509/trump-climate-change-fuel-economy-standards-coronavirus-pandemic-peak" target="_blank" > Read more about Obama's ruling in comparison to Trump's ruling here. </a> &nbsp; This is all to say that my assumption is that Biden will either adopt Obama’s standards of 54.5 MPG or increase those standards given the new circumstances. It is difficult to know the answer to whether he will increase the Obama-era standards or maintain them given the unique economic situation amongst COVID-19.

                  What Biden will do concerning clean energy and electric vehicle implementation and manufacturing is still unclear. The current state of the economy due to the Coronavirus as well as “cleaning up” after Trump has caused many of the specifics of these policies to be postponed. Though climate change policy seems to be in the front of his mind, there are many things that Biden must accomplish first, like rolling out vaccines and boosting the suffering economy. Even though many of his climate plans have the ability to improve the economy, they are slightly controversial at the moment with Republicans and it may be a bad political move to try to implement these plans so early in his presidency. Once he has established a more stable economy, I believe that Biden will implement rulings similar to those of the Obama administration with even more progressive and strict regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. Many other countries have moved faster in terms of electric vehicle manufacturing and consumption, which will eventually force American manufacturers to follow in order to maintain global demand. Many citizens of the United States are excited by Biden’s refreshing outlook on climate change but are concerned that it will all eventually be reversed by the next Republican leader. The fact that big companies have already started showing interest in electric vehicle production means they are less likely to ever completely go back to their dependence on combustion engine production. I believe that if the Biden administration sticks to even half of what they wish to accomplish in the next four years that American life will be drastically different and we will meet the requirements involved in the Paris Agreement, showing that we are a country to look up to instead of a country to look down upon in terms of climate change mitigation.
